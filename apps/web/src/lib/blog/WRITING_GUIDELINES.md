# MindScript Blog Writing Guidelines

## Voice and Tone
- Write like a knowledgeable friend, not a textbook or a marketing bot
- Be direct and confident without being preachy
- Present science honestly: cite real studies, acknowledge limitations, avoid overclaiming
- Respect the reader's intelligence. Don't over-explain obvious things

## Avoiding AI Writing Tells
These patterns immediately signal AI-generated content. Never use them:

- **Em dashes (—):** Replace with periods, commas, colons, or restructure the sentence
- **"In today's fast-paced world..."** and similar filler openers
- **"Dive into / deep dive"** as a verb for exploration
- **"Unlock / unleash"** when describing benefits
- **"Landscape" or "realm"** when describing a topic area
- **"It's important to note that..."** Just state the thing
- **"In conclusion..."** or **"To summarize..."** The reader knows it's the end
- **"This is where X comes in"** as a transition
- **"Whether you're a beginner or an expert..."** Hedging that adds nothing
- **"Look no further"** or **"has never been easier"**
- **Excessive hedging:** "It's worth mentioning that perhaps one might consider..."
- **Triple adjective lists:** "powerful, transformative, and life-changing"
- **Starting paragraphs with "So,"** or **"Now,"**
- **"Harness the power of..."**
- **Semicolons in casual prose.** Use two sentences instead

## Sentence Structure
- Vary sentence length. Short sentences hit hard. Longer ones can carry nuance and detail when the topic demands it
- Front-load the interesting part. Don't bury the point after a long setup
- Use active voice by default. Passive is fine when the actor is irrelevant
- One idea per paragraph. If you're using "additionally" or "furthermore," you probably need a new paragraph

## Formatting
- Use h2 for main sections, h3 for subsections within those
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences for web reading)
- Use bullet lists for scannable items, numbered lists for sequences
- Bold key terms on first use or when they carry the weight of a list item
- Blockquotes for key takeaways or summary statements only, not for decoration
- Italicize journal and publication names

## Content Standards
- Every claim about effectiveness must reference real research or be clearly labeled as practitioner experience
- Include practical, actionable advice. Don't just explain what something is
- Link concepts back to MindScript's features naturally, not with forced CTAs in the prose
- Each post should leave the reader knowing something specific they can try today
- Target 1,200 to 2,000 words (7 to 10 minute read)

## SEO Integration
- Focus keyphrase appears in the title, first paragraph, one h2, and meta description
- Related keywords distributed naturally through the body (don't keyword stuff)
- FAQ section answers real questions people search for (check Google's "People also ask")
- Internal links to related blog posts where relevant
- Alt text on images should be descriptive, not keyword-stuffed
