# MindScript Keyword Map

## Positioning Ladder
Start soft, go deeper as trust builds. Lead with science and transformation, not clinical/hypnosis framing.

## Landing Page Rules
- Every landing page is a SEPARATE route from the index (e.g., `/subconscious-reprogramming`)
- Do NOT modify the main mindscript.studio homepage
- Every landing page MUST have the builder embedded or immediate access to it
- CTA: start building right there, $0.99 entry point
- Scientific or claim-heavy content MUST include credible sources (peer-reviewed studies, established institutions — not random blog posts)
