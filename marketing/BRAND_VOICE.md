# MindScript Brand Voice Guide

## Core Identity
MindScript is a personal audio creation tool for subconscious transformation. Users build custom audio tracks that combine their own voice (or premium AI voices), curated background music, binaural beats, and solfeggio frequencies.

## Positioning Statement
MindScript empowers you to create personalized audio that speaks directly to your subconscious — combining the science of sound frequencies with the power of your own voice to drive real transformation.

              Science-backed warmth
```

- **Warm but grounded** — we believe in the science, and we make it accessible
- **Empowering, not prescriptive** — "you create" not "we deliver"
- **Curious, not preachy** — invite exploration, don't lecture
- **Confident, not hype-y** — state what the research shows, don't oversell

## DO

- Lead with the transformation / outcome / feeling
- Use "you" and "your" — it's personal
- Reference science and research when making claims
- Frame the product as a creation tool — the user is the active agent
- Use sensory language: "hear your own voice guiding you", "feel the frequencies shift your state"
- Acknowledge that practices like meditation, affirmations, and sound therapy have long histories
- Let the reader come to their own conclusions

## DON'T

- Lead with "hypnosis" in Tier 1 content (save for Tier 3)
- Make medical claims ("cures anxiety", "treats depression")
- Use manipulative urgency ("limited time!", "act now!")
- Sound like a late-night infomercial
- Use jargon without explaining it
- Be dismissive of traditional or spiritual practices
- Overuse exclamation marks
- Say "brainwashing" unironically in marketing copy (fine for provocative blog hook titles)
